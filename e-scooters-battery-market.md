<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-scooters Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lead-acid</li><li>Li-ion</li><li>NiMH</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The e-scooter battery market comprises three main types: lead-acid, lithium-ion (Li-ion), and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH). Lead-acid batteries are cost-effective but heavy, offering limited energy density and shorter lifespans. Li-ion batteries are lightweight, offer high energy density, and have longer life cycles, making them the preferred choice for many e-scooters. NiMH batteries provide a middle ground, being more environmentally friendly than lead-acid while offering better performance than lead-acid, but not matching Li-ion in terms of efficiency and weight.</p></p>
